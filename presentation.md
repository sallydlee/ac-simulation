## Project Scope


- **Objective:** Simulate the behavior of the villagers (agents) from Animal Crossing
- **Goal:** Introductory exploration of combining discrete-event simulation (DES) and agent-based modeling (ABM)
- **Methodology:** Python, DES, ABM

## Discrete Event Simulation and Agent-based Modeling

- DES:
    - Discrete events model villager schedules
    - Well-suited for structured, event-driven villager behaviors
- ABM: 
    - System of autonomous agents and behavior
    - Interaction with each other and environment

## Agent-based Modeling Research and Applications

- ***Dynamic Models of Segregation***: Thomas Schelling 1971
- **Market Dynamics**: Consumer behavior patterns, product diffusion
- **Epidemic Research**: Used during COVID-19
- **Urban Traffic**: Simulate driver behaviors to manage traffic flows
- **Customer Experience**: Customer behavior in store to improve service and store layout
